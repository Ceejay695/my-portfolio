<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Kelvin and I think I'm introverted, not completely sure though.
  I love staying indoor brecause I just can't be bothered with going out
  of the house. Well that's what you'd see on the face value but if I actually
  get  comfortable with a person, I think I can be a bit extroverted. Sometimes.

  Don't really do much.
  <ul>
    <li>I like Basketball</li>
    <li>Sometimes football is cool</li>
    <li>Love art</li>
  </ul>
  There are some more can't think of them right now.
